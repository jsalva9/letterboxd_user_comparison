- Bugs:

- Better frontend:
        - [OK finally] TOML config
        - [OK] Canviar la lletra negra per un altre color.. passar el color de la lletra donat pel config com par√†metre de custom_write()
        - Background picture
    - Profile pictures

General ideas:
- Get list of followers and following and make a rank of matching profiles
- (Generalization of the one above) Explore the space of letterboxd users in a tree way (BFS) to find the most matching profiles
- Put the user selection page in the sidebar?

Done:
- [OK] Rethink what we want to plot
- New similarity kpi that only takes into account movies rated from both users
- Improve way we work with data. Make everything accessible through data control
    - Data Control lives in st.session_state
- Check that there are users introduced before loading Analytics page
- Little script to admin the database
- [BugFix] Sometimes the similarity metric with ratings displays all decimals
- Improve analytics page
    - Get favorite movies list from each user
    - Implement the couple metrics on fav films
